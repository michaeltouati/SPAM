SPAM (Stopping Power of Protons and Alpha particles in Ambiant Matter) is a 
python tool allowing for printing and saving the stopping power and/or the 
Bragg's peak of protons or alpha particles in ambiant matter.
You can find the litterature that has been used to write the code in the 
folder litterature. In order to use it, create a folder in your home directory

$mkdir /home/me/my_spam

For example, I did

$mkdir /home/mtouati/spam-test

Then, 

$cd /home/me/my_spam

and just type

$python3 /share/apps/spam-1.0/spam.py
